# Shape-Aware CUDA Generation Prompt

You are given a PyTorch model, input specification, original shape, and shape variants. Write a high-performance CUDA/C++ extension implementation that matches the PyTorch model's output across all listed shapes.

## Goal

Optimize the given model for CUDA execution while preserving numerical correctness across shape changes.

## Requirements

- Implement the operation using CUDA/C++ extension code.
- Match the PyTorch reference output within the provided tolerance.
- Use runtime tensor shape information instead of hardcoded dimensions.
- Handle the original shape and all provided shape variants.
- Handle smaller and larger shapes.
- Handle odd dimensions.
- Handle non-power-of-two dimensions.
- Handle batch-size changes when a batch dimension is present.
- Include boundary checks so tail elements and partial blocks are correct.
- Avoid assuming dimensions are block-aligned, warp-aligned, or powers of two.
- Avoid using PyTorch tensor operations inside the generated CUDA kernel.
- Return output tensors with the same shape and dtype expected by the PyTorch reference.
- Preserve performance where possible, but do not trade away correctness on shape variants.

## Output

Provide only the generated implementation code and any minimal build glue required by the harness.

Do not include unrelated explanation, training code, reinforcement learning code, or large benchmark scripts.
